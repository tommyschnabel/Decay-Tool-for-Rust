This is a simple tool for making sure your base in Rust doesn't decay without your knowing. Pretty simple stuff, add a timer for your foundation, notifications will alert you when your base starts decaying, right before its completely decayed, and when it is completely decayed. 

Please contribute if you can think of something to add. Just open a Pull Request and we'll get it in and live ASAP.
